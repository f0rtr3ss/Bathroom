 * This is a simple program to keep track of students going to the
 * bathroom in class. Not really that useful, but good practice 
 * and kind of hilarious. Uses a linked queue set up with a pool
 * for used and unused nodes so as to avoid needlessly allocating
 * deallocating, and reallocating said nodes. Good stuff!
